# Self_Assessment
A self assessment for my final project.
## Self Assessment
Over the course of the project, I took on a couple of roles including creating visualizations and the dashboard and also writing a couple of sections in the readme. I also took time to review every pull request and asked questions through our Zoom meetings to make sure were all on the same page.

My greatest personal challenge was when I lost my childhood dog and Unlce Frank. We had to put her down the day before the presentation due to getting very sick and my Uncle passed the morning before my dog passed. It was a challenge getting through the presentation knowing I just lost someone so close to my heart. My family are still greiving a lot. I am very thankful of my team because they gave me time and support I needed the night I lost them. They made sure everything on my side of the presentation was good and ready to go so I did not have to worry. One my teammates, Kim, even asked if I would be there because she was willing to take over my spot. 
## Team Assessment
My team was great! Our primary communication was through Zoom calls and Slack. We would openly talk about the project with each other everyday in Slack, have a Zoom call basically everyday to fix and make the code look good amonst other things, and always made sure if ateam member could not make it to a meeting, we check them up as soon as possible.
## Summary of Project
Our project focuses on the relationship of a company's stock performance to the geographic location of that company's home office or headquarters. We collected top 100 performing NASDAQ company data from different sources and used two types of models for training and testing (Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees). Ultimately our results proved inconclusive based on the scores we were getting. With a little more time and some experimentation with our chosen features or chosen models, we could probably generate higher quality predictions and answer our questions.
